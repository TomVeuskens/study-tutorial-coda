                <h3>Feature-based solid modeling</h3>
                <p>Autodesk Fusion 360 is a feature-based 3D solid modeling application. This means that 2D sketches are turned into 3D solid models using modeling features, such as "Extrude", "Revolve", "Sweep", etc. The benefit of feature-based modeling approaches is that the resulting 3D geometry can easily be altered by changing the underlying sketches/features.</p>
                <p>In the video below, we create a sketch, which is then extruded and altered to showcase this principle.</p>
