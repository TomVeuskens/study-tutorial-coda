                    During this study you will be asked to specify parametric behavior in 3D CAD models using two approaches. We will start with a generic training on what constraints in 3D CAD modeling are and why it's useful to specify parametric behavior in 3D CAD models.
                    Next, we'll give a training task in the same format as the actual study tasks. Before starting each task, we will show you how to complete the training task in the assigned tool after which you are given time to replicate the illustrated procedures.
                    If you have not used Autodesk Fusion 360 before, or if you want to refresh your memory, we created a small optional tutorial to explain the basics that you will need to successfully complete the tasks.
