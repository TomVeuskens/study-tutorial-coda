                Below, you can find a training task in the same format as the tasks you will be given in the remainder of the study. As the purpose of this training task is to get familiar with the tools that you will need during the remainder of the study, we will show how to complete the training task below the task definition. You can replicate the procedures illustrated on this page to get familiar with the tools.

                <p>As the purpose of this training task is to get familiar with the tools that you will be using during the remainder of the study, we will now show how to complete the training task in both systems. On this page, you can view the procedure for the CODA condition. You are free to replicate the procedures illustrated on this page until you feel confident to start with the actual task in the CODA condition. </p>
                <p>CODA provides suggestions to constrain relations that are currently satisfied in the design but are not constrained to always be satisfied. When you accept a suggestion, CODA automatically adds the correct constraints to the model to ensure the relation will always be satisfied, even when changes are made to the model. To successfully complete the task in CODA you will thus have to browse the list of suggestions, identify the suggestions that propose the intended behavior, and tell CODA to add the correct constraints by accepting the suggestion. </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <b>In the video below, the side panel has a uniform width of 20mm. However, when changing the size of the laptop, this relation breaks.</b>
                        <p>Upon opening the correct sketch, we notice CODA provides suggestions for parallel constraints. When hovering the suggestion for parallel lines at the top of the side leg, we indeed verify through the animation that the current behavior is undesired as the animation clearly shows that the material of the side leg will not necessarily stay uniform. We thus accept the suggestion to let CODA add the correct constraint to prevent this undesired movement from happening.</p>

                        </video>
                        <p>Moreover, we see suggestions for perpendicular constraints in CODA. Again, by hovering the suggestions, we notice that the angle between the left and the bottom line is not fixed, resulting again in a possible non-uniform thickness. As this is undesired behavior, we again let CODA add the correct constraint to the model.</p>

                        <b>In the video below, the top edge is divided in five parts: two tabs and three cutouts between the tabs. The cutouts are a quarter of the laptop size, and the tabs are half the size of the cutouts. However, when changing the size of the laptop, these relations break.</b>
                        <p>In the list of suggestions provided by CODA, we also see a category "Dimensional suggestions". When opening this list, we see that there are multiple suggestions that we need to process. To more quickly find the correct one, we can filter the list by indicating between which lines we are looking for a relation. As shown in the video below, we can do this by selecting the respective lines in the design. </p>

                        <p>When we accept the suggestion, CODA adds the correct algebraic expressions to the dimensions to ensure the tabs resize as desired.</p>

                        <b>In the video below, the height of the two tabs are equal in size. However, when changing the height of top-left tab, this relations breaks.</b>
                        <p>Similar to the previous task, we can select some of the lines of the tabs to filter the suggestions and then accept the suggestion.</p>

                        <b>In the video below, the thickness (extrusion) of the top panel is equal to the height of the tabs. However, when the height of the tab changes, this relation breaks.</b>
                        <p>To complete this task, we have to go to the 3D view of the design. We can do this either by clicking on "Finish Sketch" in the Fusion 360 interface, or by clicking the "3D view" tab in CODA. The second method is shown below.</p>
                        <video controls>
                            <source src="images/coda-trainingtask4-coda-0.mp4" type="video/mp4"/>
                        </video>
                        <p>Independent of which method we use to get to the 3D view, once we are in the 3D view we see that the suggestions of CODA are updated to include suggestions between multiple modeling features, and between modeling features and sketch entities. We can also hover the suggestions in 3D to analyze the implication of the suggestion.</p>

                        </video>
                        <p>Finally, once we identify the correct suggestion, we accept it and CODA again makes sure that the relation is correctly constrained into the design.</p>
