        <p>You will now be presented a number of tasks, in increasing order of complexity. For each task, you are given a maximum amount of time, which is specified per task. If you have completed the task before this time has elapsed, you can manually move to the next task. Note that once you end a task and proceed with the study, you cannot go back. If you are still working on a model when the time elapses, your progress will be saved and the model will be automatically closed. After finishing each task, or after the time has elapsed, you are asked to go over a small questionnaire to self-rate your results.</p>
