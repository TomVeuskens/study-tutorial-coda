        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>We developed a tool (CODA) which facilitates (novice) designers in specify constraints and parametric behavior in 3D CAD models. Correctly specifying parametric behavior in a model enables the easy creation of design variations and allows for reusing CAD models.</p>
        <p>As commercial 3D CAD modeling programs already allow for specifying constraints and parametric behavior, at present we are performing a comparative study between the tool we developed and the features present in a commercial 3D CAD modeling program (Autodesk Fusion 360) to add constraints. We set up this study to compare the ease-of-use and speed-of-use of both approaches to specify parametric behavior. Additionally, we would like to learn which features are desirable and useful to have when defining a parametric specification in a 3D CAD model.</p>
        <p>It is important to note that we are comparing the performance of the systems, not your individual performance. Moreover, participation in this experiment is entirely voluntary. Refusal to participate will involve no penalty and you may discontinue participation at any time. As such, you are free to stop the study at any point, and to decline answering any of the questions without further explanations.</p>
        <h3>Study procedure</h3>
        <p>The study will consist out of 3 main phases, as follows:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Basic training: during this phase, we will explain the Autodesk Fusion 360 interface (optional) and explain what constraints are and why they are useful in 3D CAD modeling.</li>
          <li>
            Training + tasks: during this phase, you will perform two tasks where you will be asked to make two 3D CAD models parametric according to a given parametric specification. One of the tasks will be done in Autodesk Fusion 360 wheras the other will be performed with CODA. Depending on which order you are assigned to, you will either start with Autodesk Fusion 360 or with CODA. You will perform a training task in each condition before starting the actual task:
            <ol>
              <li>Training: before each task, there will be a training phase. In this phase, we will show how to perform a task in the assigned tool. Afterwards, you are given time to replicate the illustrated procedure to get familiar with the tool. During this phase, you are allowed to ask questions and/or clarifications to the researcher that is guiding your study session.</li>
              <li>Task: after completing the training for a specific tool, you will start the actual study task in that tool. For the task, you are allowed to take up to 20 minutes, after which the task will be cut off.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>Debriefing: after completion of both tasks, we will go to the final phase of the study, in which we will go over a debriefing survey to evaluate your subjective experience during this study.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Information we collect and Privacy concerns</h3>
        <p>We will observe how you perform the tasks in both tools. During execution of the tasks, the screen will be recorded for later reference. Moreover, your interactions (mouse and keyboard presses) are logged to a text file to allow for analysis. Your contributions will remain pseudonymous and will be treated confidentially. Because of pseudonymization, your right to request access to, or alter, your data will be technically possible only right after you have finished your participation. Your test data (i.e., performance metrics) is never eligible for alteration.</p>
        <p>We may publish research reports that include your comments and actions but your data will be anonymous. This means your personal information will never be disclosed in our research reports.</p>
        <p>Your data will be stored in a private cloud-based repository as provided by the infrastructure of Hasselt University until five years after the publication of the results of our study.</p>
        <p><b>The Hasselt University research team thanks you in advance for your participation in this study.<br/>Tom Veuskens, Raf Ramakers</b><br/>Contact: tom.veuskens@uhasselt.be</p>
