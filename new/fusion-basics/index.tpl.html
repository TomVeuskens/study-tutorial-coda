                <h3>Feature-based solid modeling</h3>
                <p>Autodesk Fusion 360 is a feature-based 3D solid modeling application. This means that 2D sketches are turned into 3D solid models through modeling features, such as "Extrude", "Revolve", "Sweep", etc. A simple example of creating a sketch and extruding it to a 3D model is shown below.</p>

                </video>
                <p>The main benefit of this modeling approach is that the resulting 3D geometry can easily be altered by changing the features. For example, when the sketch or the Extrude Feature is changed, the geometry is updated, as shown below.</p>

                <p>During these actions I interacted with several different parts of the Autodesk Fusion 360 interface. We will now look at the different parts that will be useful in the remainder of this study.</p>
