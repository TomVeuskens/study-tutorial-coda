                    During this study you will need to specify parametric behavior in 3D CAD models. You will be asked to perform this in 2 tools: <b>Autodesk Fusion 360</b> and <b>CODA</b>. Autodesk Fusion 360 is a commercial 3D CAD program. CODA is a plugin we implemented on top of Autodesk Fusion 360.
                    During this training phase, we will explain what constraints are and why it's useful to specify parametric behavior in 3D CAD models. Next, we'll give you a training task in the same format as the actual tasks in this study - and show you how you can successfully complete this task in both conditions. You are given time to replicate this training procedure yourself.
                    If you have never used Autodesk Fusion 360, or if you want to refresh your memory, we created a small optional tutorial to explain the basics of Autodesk Fusion 360 that you will need when completing the tasks.
